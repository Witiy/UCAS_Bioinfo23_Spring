# UCAS_Bioinfo23_Spring

This is the repository for Bioinformatics 23 Spring in UCAS. In this course, a website for searching splicing events from three different cell types(MN, NPC, iPSC) will be implemented. The data is from the article Song, Yan, et al. "Single-cell alternative splicing analysis with expedition reveals splicing dynamics during neuron differentiation." Molecular cell 67.1 (2017): 148-161. The processed data is `MN_NPC_iPSC_PSI.csv`. You can create a table (name `splicing`) in mysql using this data, and modify the mysql script in the code, and the website will work.

## Preprocess
My environment is `windows10 wsl2`. So you need to install php first (https://blog.iw3c.com/archive/windows10-wsl-nmp). Then i use a auto-clone tool for getting template html and css file (https://www.jianshu.com/p/a40d903f0a2f). The template website is (http://gwaskb.stanford.edu/).

## Documentation
The documentation could be seen in the `about.html`. You can also click `Documentation` in the website.
